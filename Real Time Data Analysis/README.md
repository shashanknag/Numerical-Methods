## Real Time Data Analysis

This assignment involves analysing the real time data generated by a probe, and hence studying the movement of blood cells in our body. When a blood cell across
the probing region, it creates a peak in the measured values. The aim is to find the mean cell width and its velocity by analysing the occurance of the peak in real time.
